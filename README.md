# My Dash Cheatsheets

The shortcuts and general tips which I am using but keeping forgetting.

## Build

1. Install [mise](mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html);
2. Clone this git repo and open terminal within the code dir;
3. Run `mise install`;
4. Run `bundle install`;
5. Run `make`

## Usage

1. Build the doc;
2. Open Dash and navigate to the main page. Click on "Manage Docsets," followed
    by the "+" icon at the bottom left. Select "Add Local Docsets," and choose
    the previously built `.docset` folder.
